         <p class="font1">IBM with their business partner Allsoft Solutions started their summer Training
             program for June to August 2021. The program had instructors from IBM who tought in 
             various domains such as Artificial  Intelligence using WATSON, Python Libraries, C++ Advanced, 
             Radar Security, Android App Development, Flutter App Development, and many more!
             I did my training in the domain of Artificial Intelligence using WATSON.
         </p>
         <p class="font1">The first step of the program to get yourself accepted was based on a highly
             competitive coding challenge which delt with solving DSA questions as well as 10% of the total
             questions containing information bout the IBM Cloud. Luckily I had read and researched about
             IBM Cloud in the same week of the challenge and was also well versed with all the DSA problems
             and questions. With my performance I was able to grab an 87% IBM scholarhship and got accepted
             into the program of my choice which mentioned above earlier! 
         </p>
         <p class="font1">The 6 week program started off on 8th of June 2022 with an interactive session
             with my mentor, Mr. Ishan Vaid who worked with IBM. We started off the initial classes with
             Python programming language and went on to study Python Libraries. We went deep into Pandas
             and after being comfortable with the language started with WATSON.
              </p>
         <p class="font1">Watson is a question-answering computer system capable of answering questions posed
             in natural language, developed in IBM's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal
             investigator David Ferrucci. Watson was named after IBM's founder and first CEO, industrialist
             Thomas J. Watson. We worked specifically on WATSON Assistant. IBM Watson Assistant is an AI service
             in IBM Cloud that lets you build, train and deploy Chabot over the cloud. After the making of 
            chatbox, we were asked to build our own project using all the knowlege we gained during these 6 weeks.
         </p>
         <p class="font1">The project I made is called AIR CANVAS. You can read more bout the project <a href="https://devpost.com/software/air-canvas-z3qxrl"> <h4>here.</h4> </a>
